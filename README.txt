Find something you like, but think it's too expensive? Want that jacket that person is wearing? See something you want on instagram but don't know where to buy it? Our app is the beginnings to a solution to those problems. When fully implemented, you will be able to take or upload a picture, and it will give you online or real stores around you selling that item, listed by price, and buy then with a click if they chose. Users would be able to help give better results by suggesting tags for pictures they give. The result? A store powered by you, the people.
